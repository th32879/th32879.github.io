		Introduction </span> </h3> </div>
		
		<p> Generally, I listen to most genres of
			music. Since my parents exposed me to so many types of
			music at such a young age, I now have a very diverse
			music taste. My dad listened to mainly jazz, classic
			rock, rap, reggae, and grunge. My mom listened to pop
			music, classic rock, and jazz. My parents both loved
			jazz because they grew up in New Orleans, where it is
			extremely popular. Between my parents' preferences as
			well as what I have grown to like on my own, I have
			been able to create an excellent, everchanging
			collection of music to listen to daily.
		</p>
		
		<div STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER" class="indented">
		<p class="dotted"> <h3> Pop </h3> </div> 
		
		<p> Pop music is one of my favorite genres. There is constantly
			pop music that is being released. However, pop music has
			become extremely mainstream; therefore, the songs are known
			by most. Pop can mean many different sounds. For example,
			there is pop music by artists such as Michael Jackson. Although,
			comparing it to more prominent artists of today such as Katy Perry
			or Justin Bieber proves that pop music, as well as music overall, is
			constantly changing and evolving. Many artists of all genres
			will dabble in pop music nowadays, so it is a highly-known and
			popular genre.

		<p class="dotted"> <h3> Jazz </h3> </div>
		
		<p> Jazz in the United States originated in Louisiana, which is where
			my parents and I are from. Therefore, it is one of my favorite
			genres. My favorite artist overall is Amy Winehouse, however I
			also appreciate the music of Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. 
			<del>Between you and I, Amy Winehouse will forever be the best.</del>
			I love smooth but also sassy voices in jazz. Billie Holiday is one
			of my favorites as well. I love when the jazz music involves lots of
			trumpet and is upbeat.

		<div STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER" class="indented">
		<p class="dotted"> <h3> Reggae </h3> </div>
		
		<p> Although he is extremely well-known, Bob Marley would have to be my
			favorite reggae artist. Some people don't enjoy reggae because they
			think that it all sounds the same, but I enjoy it. Reggae is
			relaxing and peaceful to me. It puts me into a better mood. My favorite
			songs by Bob Marley are "Is This Love?" and "Buffalo Soldier." His sons,
			Damian and Stephen Marley, made a song called "Medication" that I like to
			listen to as well. I listened to reggae when I was on a cruise to the
			Bahamas, so now every time I hear it, I think of the Bahamas.

		<div STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER" class="indented">
		<p class="dotted"> <h3> Trap </h3> </div>
		
		<p> Trap music as well as rap music is one of my favorites as well. It is
			"hype" music that you can get lit to. It's best to listen to when you
			are on the way to go do something fun. The most popular artists in 
			either trap or rap music currently are Migos, 21 Savage, Travi$ Scott,
			Cardi B, and Nicki Minaj. I personally love Cardi B and her hit song
			"Bodak Yellow" as well as her verse on the song "Motorsport," which 
			also features Migos and Nicki Minaj. This type of music has slowly
			but surely began to dominant the charts. This is becoming an "everyone"
			type of music, meaning many types of people can listen to and like
			this music. It is becoming popular in celebrity culture as well.

		<p class="dotted"> <h3> Alternative Rock/Grunge </h3> </div>
		
		<p> My like of alternative rock and grunge music has definitely developed thanks
			to my parents. They were big fans of bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam,
			and this transferred over to me. This is the type of musi that my dad and
			I listen to whenever we're in the car together. I enjoy Nirvana as well.
			My favorite songs by Nirvana are mostly on their album <i> Nevermind </i>.
			The lead singer of the band Nirvana quite unfortunately died in 1994,
			ending the band's career. However, Dave Grohl, the drummer, went on to be
			extremely successful in the music industry by starting his own bands, the
			most famous being "The Foo Fighters."

		<p class="dotted"> <h3> Classic Rock </h3> </div>
		
		<p> Lastly, I am a huge fan of classic rock. This comes from my parents as well.
			They would always show me iconic songs from the 1970s and 80s (in terms of
			classic rock), and as a family, we would play a game on the PlayStation called
			<i> Rockband </i>. My favorite classic rock bands are Journey, Boston, Bon
			Jovi, and Queen. I would always love to sing a good rock ballad! My favorite 
			classic rock song is "Bohemian Rhapsody," and it is very common in my family
			for all of us to join in singing this, even though no one can <i> really </i>
			hit the notes of Freddie Mercury like he can.
